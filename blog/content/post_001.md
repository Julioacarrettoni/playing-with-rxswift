# Background story
The key to a good product is a good story, it is true for presentations<sup>[1](#1)</sup>, commercials<sup>[2](#2)</sup> and even apps<sup>[3](#3)</sup>, so here is the one I came up with for this blog:

You recently joined a small mobile team in a medium company, this company is big enough to have processes and a little burocracy but not big enough to already have a mobile department. Their technology is a little old and most engineers are busy maintaining the core products, so you will have to work with what you are given and it is rarely going to be ideal, well not ideal for you but ideal for me who control the plot. üòÅ

Anyway, the company is call _Thomson Brother's Division_ or TBD for short<sup>[4](#4)</sup>, they do a little of everything including logistics. In recent years they decided it was time to modernize and they plan to launch their fleet control system on the mobile world.

</div>

The CEO wants everything to be modern and shiny, they read somewhere (probably a newsletter) that React Native is the next big thing, they also found that Rx is a react framework available on both Android and iOS so the app has to be build using RxSwift (Yes I know ReactNative and Rx are different things but the CEO doesn't so ü§´).

That's where you enter, they hired you to build those mobile apps using RxSwift and SwiftUI but although you know some RxSwift you don't consider yourself an expert (otherwise you wouldn't be wasting you time here).
Someone already wrote a proof of concept app that was a success across the company directors and to "save time" you _have to_ build on top of that instead of starting from scratch like any sane human been would do<sup>[5](#5)</sup>.

### The app
The first app we need to build is the "Overview" app. Is an app where managers can see the current status of their distribution center.  
A distribution center has couriers and vehicles, clients make requests and packages are delivered from the distribution center to the client address, dependending of the distance the courier might go on foot or in a vehicle.
The App has to show:
1. A Map that shows the locations and status of:
   * Couriers
   * Vehicles
   * Clients (active)
   * The warehouse location

2. A tabbed section that shows list of the following elements and when selected display more details about them:
   * Couriers
   * Packages
   * Vehicles

 On this episode we will only focus on the **Map** part.

### The Server
Sadly as this company has been running for a long time most of the core technology is old. The server is build on some very old and obsolete technology, something like Java‚Ä¶ just teasing, it's build on COBOL and communicates back using CORBA and SOAP.<sup>[5](#5)</sup>.  
Luckily the guy who wrote the POC app is a backend engineer and created a ruby middleware that translates to JSON so we can use it. We don't care what the JSON looks like parsing server responses is not something we will cover on this episodes in detail we will just relay on the [FakeService framework](@/post_000.md#a-different-sample-app) to abstract from all that noise.

# Code {#skip_intro}
You can download the sample apps from [here](https://github.com/Julioacarrettoni/playing-with-rxswift/tree/master/001), you should start working on the _before_ folder, at the end it should look like the _after_ folder.
