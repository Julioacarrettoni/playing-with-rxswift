Before diving into the problems and try throwing code at it, let me tell you about the structure of the project, the goals and how things are supposed to work around here.

# Goal
Learn a more about [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) by building a _different_ kind of sample app based on [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and [SwiftUI](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) using [Xcode](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift).


# Motivation
I find myself learning about new things that can be achieved with RxSwift by reading other people's code, never by reading posts about how `map` or `flatMap` works.

Maybe I lack the imagination necessary to translate all those marble diagrams and fake static number generators nobody use into "_real world_" problems, maybe it just that's not the way I learn, or you know, maybe I haven't tried hard enough.

Anyway I decided to start tinkering with RxSwift a little more, I googled and asked on twitter ([here](https://twitter.com/dev_jac/status/1230657972470075392)), I found the usual books, [RxSwift: Reactive Programming with Swift](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/rxswift), talks like the ones at (Realm Academy)[https://academy.realm.io/posts/learning-path-rxswift-from-start-to-finish/] and tutorials which usually cover individual aspects like operators and always using those damn marbles üôÑ

After some time I decided the best was to create a dummy app and play with it, but what kind of app? Most of the apps one can build for tinkering are passive, meaning you find a free service that returns some fancy data, like [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api), you fetch it and render it nicely, and that's it. What kind of "Reactive" stuff can be built around a bunch of GET HTTP calls?

If you are lucky you might find a since open API that also includes some POST and PUT HTTP calls (like [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/account/mark-as-favorite)) but still, is not very reactive and also kinda limiting if you want to explore other concepts like unit testing or if you want to tinker in a reactive but repetitive way that let you try different approaches for the same situation.

As I wrote on my [twitter bio](https://twitter.com/dev_jac) a long time ago, "_If it doesn't exist I'll make it_".

Initially, I started building it just for myself and it was never intended to be shared so let me warn you, it is going to be rough around the edges‚Ä¶ and sometimes on the middle, top, bottom, front and rear too üòÖ.

I decided to share it because in the same way you might [figure out a bug while explaining it to a rubber duck ü¶Ü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) explaining something you think you understand to someone else also helps you understand it better yourself.

Also, I thought this whole blogging thing was going to be easier, but so far is torture! ‚ò†Ô∏è

Without more preamble let's discuss the technology stack.
