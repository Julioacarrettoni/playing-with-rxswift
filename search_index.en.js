diving into the problems and start throwing code at it, let me tell you about the structure of the project, the goals and how things are supposed to work around here.\n\n\nGoal\nLearn more about RxSwift by building a different kind of sample app based on Swift and SwiftUI using Xcode.\nWhy RxSwift?\nThe best answer for that is here\n\n\nMotivation\nI find myself learning about new things that can be achieved with RxSwift by reading other people's code, rarely by reading posts about how map or flatMap works.\nMaybe I lack the imagination necessary to translate all those marble diagrams and fake static number generators nobody use into \"real world\" problems, perhaps that's not the way I learn, or you know, maybe I haven't tried hard enough.\n\nAnyway, I decided to start tinkering with RxSwift a little more, I googled and asked on twitter (here), I found the usual books, RxSwift: Reactive Programming with Swift, the usual talks like the ones at Realm Academy and tutorials which usually cover individual aspects like operators and always using those damn marbles 🙄\nI started hanging around the RxSwift repository reading the docs (they are great), and one thing I found that is invaluable for experimenting is the Swift Playground that comes with the repo (here) this is a tool you should always keep at hand.\nAfter some time, I decided the best way to learn more was to create a dummy app and play with it, but what kind of app?\nMost of the apps one can build for tinkering are passive, meaning you find a free service that returns some fancy data, like Open Weather Map, you fetch it and render it nicely, and that's it. What kind of \"Reactive\" stuff can be built around a bunch of GET HTTP calls that always return the same thing???\n🌤🌥🌦🌨🌩⛈🌪\nIf you are lucky you might find a nice open API that also includes some POST and PUT HTTP calls (like The Movie Database API) but still, is not very reactive and also kinda limiting if you want to explore other concepts like unit testing or if you want to tinker in a reactive but repetitive way that let you try different approaches for the same situation.\nAs I wrote on my twitter bio a long time ago, \"If it doesn't exist I'll make it\".\nInitially, I started building it just for myself and it was never intended to be shared, so let me warn you, it is going to be rough around the edges… and sometimes on the middle, top, bottom, front, and rear too 😅.\nI'm sharing it because, in the same way, you might figure out a bug while explaining it to a rubber duck 🦆 teaching something you think you understand to someone else also helps you understand it better yourself.\nAlso, I thought this whole blogging thing was going to be easier, but so far is torture! ☠️\nWithout more preamble, let's discuss the technology stack 🥞.\n\n\nTechnology\nThe bundle versions of Swift and SwiftUI that comes with Xcode (right now it is 11.4 beta 3 (11N132i)) will be used and therefore recommended to follow this posts.\n\nThe project has 2 dependencies:\n\nRxSwift 5.1.0.\nFakeService, a toy Swift framework built for this project.\n\nRxSwift will be integrated using Swift Package manager.\nFakeService is pre-loaded and configured on the sample project.\nThe objective of this project is to explore the capabilities of RxSwift and try to build complex/funny contractions with it, SwiftUI and Swift Package manager were chosen because those require less explanation and setup than the alternatives, I believe they are a good fit for this project.\nI'm not advocating for those technologies in particular over other options.\nYou shouldn't treat the published code as production-ready, nor it's written with best practices in mind. Instead, brevity and simplicity are prioritized to avoid distracting the reader from the primary goal, have fun with RxSwift.\nPosts have a companion folder in the repo with the code in the initial state (before folder) and how it should look like by the end of it (after folder).\n\n\nA different sample app\nAs I ranted before, most tutorials or sample apps are too simple or far from the \"real\" world, what makes this sample app different from others is the FakeService framework, nothing more than a simple service mock.\nI'm shipping the source code so you can see it doesn't contain any magic (or good coding practices 😁)\nThis framework impersonates our fictitious company backend, this way we don't have to work with boring data or install fancy software to deal with the 4096 dependencies from the other fancy software used to run a different fancy software just to have some fun data to play with, plus it comes with some handy mock functionality to control time for example.\nThe framework comes with pre-recorded activity, exposes some server look-alike \"endpoints\", for simplicity first episodes contain a simpler version of it but more functionality is made available as episodes progress (if I ever publish them that is)\nTopics\nThe main topic of the blog is RxSwift and trying to find ways to leverage it's capabilities while trying not to paint ourselves into a corner.\nUnit testing, testability, and debugability will be covered briefly at the end of each post, and in-depth on special posts.\nSome details on SwiftUI will also be included as it is required to build the UI of the sample apps, but it won't be in-depth.\nAnyway, thank you for reading all this impenetrable wall of text, and I hope you enjoy the project, feel free to drop me a comment on twitter.\n\n@dev_jac\n\nNext post \n","id":"https://julioacarrettoni.github.io/playing-with-rxswift/post-000/","title":"0. Introduction"},"https://julioacarrettoni.github.io/playing-with-rxswift/post-001/":{"body":"Learn the background story, explore the sample app, and convert our first closure-driven endpoint to the Rx world by using a Single.\nFeel free to use this link to skip all the paraphernalia of the post and dive directly into the code.\nSkip intro\nBackground story\nThe key to a good product is a good story, it is true for presentations1, commercials2 and even apps3, so here is the one I came up with for this blog:\nYou recently joined a small mobile team in a medium-sized company, this company is big enough to have processes and a little bureaucracy but not big enough to already have a mobile department. Their technology is a little old, and most engineers are busy maintaining the core products.\nYou will have to work with what you are given, and it is rarely going to be ideal, well not ideal for you, but ideal for me who controls the plot. 😁\nAnyway, the company is call Thomson Brother's Division or TBD for short4, they do a little of everything including logistics. In recent years they decided it was time to modernize and they plan to launch their fleet control system on the mobile world.\nLogo created at Freelogodesign.org\nThe CEO wants everything to be modern and shiny, they read somewhere (probably a newsletter) that React Native is the next big thing, they also found that Rx is a react framework available on both Android and iOS, so the app has to be rebuilt using RxSwift (Yes I know ReactNative and Rx are different things, but the CEO doesn't so 🤫).\n\nThat's where you enter. You were hired to build those mobile apps using RxSwift and SwiftUI, but although you know some RxSwift, you don't consider yourself an expert (otherwise, you wouldn't be wasting your time here).\nSomeone already wrote a proof of concept app that was a success across the company directors and to \"save time\" you have to build on top of that instead of starting from scratch like any sane human been would do5.\nBTW the POC also uses a proprietary network library (probably written in Objective-C and built on top of ASIHTTPRequest so there is no way to modify it or use any cool network-level feature5.\nThe app\nThe first app we need to build is the \"Overview\" app. An app where managers can see the current status of their distribution center.\nA distribution center has couriers and vehicles. Clients make requests, and packages are delivered from the distribution center to the client address, depending on the distance the courier might go on foot or in a vehicle.\nThe App has to show:\n\n\nA Map that shows the locations and status of:\n\nCouriers\nVehicles\nClients (active)\nThe warehouse location\n\n\n\nA tabbed section that shows a list of the following elements and when selected display more details about them:\n\nCouriers\nPackages\nVehicles\n\n\n\nThe POC only covers the map, we need to build the rest. In this post we will solely focus on the Map part.\nThe Server\nSadly as this company has been running for a long time, most of the core technology is old. The server is built on some ancient and obsolete technology, something like Java… just teasing, it's running on COBOL and communicates back using CORBA and SOAP.5.\n\nLuckily the guy who wrote the POC app is a backend engineer and created a ruby middleware that translates to JSON. We don't care what the JSON looks like, parsing server responses is not something we will cover on this blog in detail. We will forget about it and rely on the FakeService framework to abstract from all that noise, anyway, all this background story is to say that the server engineers are busy, and you have to work with whatever endpoints you are given and get creative with them.\n\n\nWork\nGoal\nOur goal is to add the RxSwift dependency into the PoC project and then rewrite the only endpoint we have to be more \"Reactive\".\nCode\nYou will need Xcode 11.4 or newer.\nYou can download the sample apps from here, you should start working on the before folder, in the end, it should look like the after folder.\nOpen the RxPlaying.xcodeproj project. You will notice it has two targets \n\nFor simplicity, I won't cover Unit testing on this post, and I removed the unit tests for the FakeService framework, but believe me, it has Unit tests, a lot of them 😬 (no, really, it does!)\nYou can go ahead and run the RxPlaying target if you like, you can choose to run it on iOS or macOS (if you are running Catalina) either will do although it will look better on iOS, every time you run the application the same sequence will play. The map starts centered on the fictitious warehouse currently on the corner of Ellis and Stockton in San Francisco, then a client requests a package near Pier 9, and Simon gets dispatched there on a car. 🚘\nThe same JSON files (available inside the FakeService framework) are played over and over again, there is enough data for a little over 1 hour of activity for a total of 4 couriers, 2 vehicles and 17 packages being delivered to 13 different locations (some destinations are repeated).\n\nIf you check out the views inside the RxPlaying target there are 2, ContentView and MapView, we will be ignoring the MapView for now, all it has is code to render the annotations on the map, animate them and some boilerplate to communicate between UIKit and SwiftUI.\nContentView on the other hand is quite simple:\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State var globalState: GlobalState? = nil\n    \n    var body: some View {\n        MapView(globalState: self.globalState)\n            .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)\n            .onAppear(perform: self.refreshData)\n    }\n    \n    private func refreshData() {\n        Service.getSystemState() { globalState in\n            self.globalState = globalState\n            self.refreshData()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAs soon as MapView renders, the app calls Service.getSystemState, our only endpoint available for now, on the completion block the same method is called again, and again and again and again5. \"If it is stupid but it works, it is still stupid.\".\nThis is what we want to improve with a little Rx, let's get started.\nAdding the dependency\nWe will be adding RxSwift as a Swift Package dependency, (you can read why on the previous post), you can find some details on the RxSwift repository readme.md file (here) but with the recent versions of Xcode it has gotten quite simple to do.\nGo to Files→Swift Packages→Add Package Dependency…\n\nOn the top of the page enter the URL to the RxSwift repo https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift and hit Next.\n\nOn the next screen enter that we want to be using \"Up to next mayor\" and the version is 5.1.0 \n\nNow you have to select which of all the available frameworks we want, for now we will just use RxSwift.\n\nAnd finally we are left on the Swift Packages tab for the project configuration, so as you can guess RxSwift is now available for all our targets.\n\nI'm not going to compare tools or advocate in favor of some of the others as this is not the point of the blog… but…\nCOME ON that was super easy and straight forward!!! 😄\nUsing RxSwift\nNow is time to use RxSwift, let's modify the existing method that wraps around FakeService framework, it's a struct with a single static method in RxPlaying/Services/Service.swift\nimport FakeService\nimport Foundation\n\nstruct Service {\n    static func getSystemState(completion: @escaping (GlobalState?) -&gt; () ) {\n        FakeServices.shared.getSystemState(completion: completion)\n    }\n}\n\nFirst, let's import RxSwift on top\nimport FakeService\nimport Foundation\nimport RxSwift\n\nFor now, let's add a new method instead of modifying the existing one, so the rest of the app continues compiling.\nstatic func getSystemState() -&gt; ???\n\nNow, methods that take no arguments and return nothing don't seem too useful, or they are full of those nasty side effects… , anyway, we need to return something, and void doesn't cut it today, (maybe later, like in 2-3 more posts).\nWhat do we know? We know we are going to call an endpoint once and, thus, only get a single response once. It doesn't get easier than this, we need to return a Single.\nYou reader have two options, you can:\n\nSkip the following explanation by clicking 👉here👈\nContinue reading if you want to know a little more about Single. 🤓\n\nThe documentation on the github repo for RxSwift (link) is quite good ❤️, I recommend starting there anytime you have a question, at the very least we will able to find some new words that can help you google.\nNow according to the docs, this is the way to create a Single:\nfunc getRepo(_ repo: String) -&gt; Single&lt;[String: Any]&gt; {\n    return Single&lt;[String: Any]&gt;.create { single in\n        let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: URL(string: \"https://api.github.com/repos/\\(repo)\")!) { data, _, error in\n            if let error = error {\n                single(.error(error))\n                return\n            }\n\n            guard let data = data,\n                  let json = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: .mutableLeaves),\n                  let result = json as? [String: Any] else {\n                single(.error(DataError.cantParseJSON))\n                return\n            }\n\n            single(.success(result))\n        }\n\n        task.resume()\n\n        return Disposables.create { task.cancel() }\n    }\n}\n\nLet's go step for step over this example, first let's remove some noise\nfunc getSomething(_ someValue: U) -&gt; Single&lt;T&gt; {\n    return Single&lt;T&gt;.create { single in\n        someAsyncMethod(someValue) { _ in\n            //We will cover this later\n        }\n        return Disposables.create { /* some cleaning */ }\n    }\n}\n\nFirst it creates a Single as required by the return type using the create method Single&lt;T&gt;.create that takes a closure as an argument, the nice thing about Rx is that it is open source and we can take a peek at how it works (link) but sometimes it can be a little overwhelming. 😶 \npublic static func create(subscribe: @escaping (@escaping SingleObserver) -&gt; Disposable) -&gt; Single&lt;Element&gt;\n\nWhat you need to know is that this create method takes a @escaping closure meaning that whatever it does will be done later (or maybe never).\n@escaping (@escaping SingleObserver) -&gt; Disposable\n\nThe closure is where we do our async work, the closure gives us another closure called SingleObserver that we can use to communicate back the result of our async task.\nIt takes a single value, an enum SingleEvent&lt;Element&gt; that can only take 2 values, success or error, yes, it is pretty much a Result type.\npublic enum SingleEvent&lt;Element&gt; {\n    /// One and only sequence element is produced.\n    case success(Element)\n    \n    /// Sequence terminated with an error.\n    case error(Swift.Error)\n}\n\nThe closure has to return a Disposable (Don't bother with the link there is not much there) The idea with disposables is that the consumer of this methods hold on to them for as long as they are interested in getting values out of the observables, when they are no longer interested they just throw away the disposable. 🚮\nThe Disposable takes a closure that gets executed when the disposable \"dies\" or the observable completes its task; some of them never do as they are \"infinite\", but the single isn't.\nAs you can see in the original example, the disposable calls task.cancel() to perform some cleanup.\nreturn Disposables.create { task.cancel() }\n\n\nYou can create as many Singles as you want and nothing will happen, is not until you \"use\" them that the closure is computed. Also, you can create only one Single and \"re-use\" it multiple times, every time you \"use\" it the closure gets rerun.\nTo \"use\" a Single or any other ObservableType you subscribe to it, this returns a Disposable that you should hold onto or nothing will happen (and throw away when you no longer care about it), we will worry about this in a bit, let's go back to our example:\nfunc getSomething(_ someValue: U) -&gt; Single&lt;T&gt; {\n    return Single&lt;T&gt;.create { single in\n        someAsyncMethod(someValue) { _ in\n            //Is time to talk about this\n        }\n        return Disposables.create { /* some cleaning */ }\n    }\n}\n\nLet's talk now about communicating results back to the Single, let's assume for simplicity that our async method can tell us if a number is prime or whatever, so it returns a Bool but if it fails it returns nil (Yes, this error management is top-notch) and if it works it tells us either true or false, then our example would look like this replacing those U and T:\nfunc isPrime(_ someValue: UInt) -&gt; Single&lt;Bool&gt; {\n    return Single&lt;Bool&gt;.create { single in\n        someAsyncMethod(someValue) { response in\n            //And now?\n        }\n        return Disposables.create() // There is nothing to clean.\n    }\n}\n\nSo the body of that closure could be something like this:\nIf we have a boolean, we have a successful result and we tell that to the SingleObserver else it failed and we communicate that back:\nsomeAsyncMethod(someValue) { response in\n    if let response = response {\n        single(.success(response))\n    } else {\n        single(.error(SomeError.unknown))\n    }\n}\n\nBTW SomeError.unknown is just a random enum I created so I could send it back:\nenum SomeError: Error {\n    case unknown\n}\n\nAgain, this is to keep the examples simple, so should do proper error handling on your codebase, or you know, just return the optional bool and let the consumer of the method deal with it 😜\nfunc isPrime(_ someValue: UInt) -&gt; Single&lt;Bool?&gt; {\n    return Single&lt;Bool?&gt;.create { single in\n        someAsyncMethod(someValue) { response in\n            single(.success(response)) // Everything is a success as our standars are low, like code quality.\n        }\n        return Disposables.create() // There is nothing to clean.\n    }\n}\n\nDon't do this, don't be a horrible person, the consumers of your APIs could be writing your performance review next quarter. 😬\nAlso, jokes aside, we will be missing some cool functionality from Rx when we don't properly use it, for example, the remarkable retry. We will cover Error handling gradually across the series alongside unit testing.\nNow we have enough information to write our single.\nLet's create our single\nWe don't require arguments, and we expect out a GlobalState?\nstatic func getSystemState() -&gt; Single&lt;GlobalState?&gt;\n\nWe then create the Single whose element is &lt;GlobalState?&gt;\nSingle&lt;GlobalState?&gt;.create { single in\n\nThe \"body\" or task on our single is calling FakeServices.shared.getSystemState(completion:) and the way we handle errors (not the best way) is to just send back a nil if it fails, so any value is a success for us:\nFakeServices.shared.getSystemState { globalState in\n    single(.success(globalState))\n}\n\nThere is nothing to clean, so the Disposable is simply\nreturn Disposables.create()\n\nAnd all together it looks like this:\nstatic func getSystemState() -&gt; Single&lt;GlobalState?&gt; {\n    Single&lt;GlobalState?&gt;.create { single in\n        FakeServices.shared.getSystemState { globalState in\n            single(.success(globalState))\n        }\n          \n        return Disposables.create()\n    }\n}\n\nAnd we are done, we can call it a day, thank you for coming to my TedTalk, this is the end of the blog.\n\"But, how do we use it?\" 🧐 you might ask. Ok, then maybe we are not done yet.\nUsing the single\nLet's use it on our ContentView, first things first, let's buckle those belts (American Airlines joke).\nimport RxSwift\n\nLet's emptu this method\nprivate func refreshData() {\n}\n\nAnd use our new Single:\nprivate func refreshData() {\n    Service.getSystemState()\n}\n\n\nBut as I said before, if we don't subscribe, nothing happens (besides that warning about an unused result).\nWhen you try to subscribe, you will see that you have several options:\n\n\nThe 1st one subscribes and lets the Single run and do its thing but when we don't particularly care about the result.\nThe 2nd one lets you subscribe on a specific scheduler, this is not about a particular thread or queue, it's bigger than that, you can read more on the excellent ❤️docs❤️ we will revisit those later (very later) in this blog, for now all we need to know is:\n\n\nIn case it isn't explicitly specified, work will be performed on whichever thread/scheduler elements are generated.\n\n\nThe 3rd gives you one closure with the result of the single as the enum SingleEvent, so you can switch on it and do what you want all in a single place.\nThe 4th one gives you 2 closures, one with the value and one with the error, only one of those will be called, but this way, you don't have to switch over the result and can have the reaction to each case separated, or even ignore one.\n\nWhich one should we use? Well, the 1st one is useless for us right now, 2nd one is too advanced, 3rd one looks nice, but to be honest, we are doing some very lousy error handling so far, and we don't care about handling the error scenario, so the 4th one it is!\nprivate func refreshData() {\n    Service.getSystemState().subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n        // Something\n    }) { error in\n        // Error handling\n    }\n}\n\nI said we don't care about error handling because we are lousy developers.\nprivate func refreshData() {\n    Service.getSystemState().subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n        // Something\n    })\n}\n\nAlmost there, we have forgotten to grab onto the disposable, if we don't nothing will happen, besides the useful compile warning that is also covered on the ❤️docs❤️ but again it could be a little overwhelming so TL;DR version, we just grab all those disposables and thrown them into a bag, we tied the lifetime of the bag to something that makes sense like our View, and we can't forget about it. If we leave this page, the View gets deallocated, that kills the bad and the bag, in turn, kills all the disposables on it, and they do the cleanup on their last breath. ☠️\nSometimes you want to have more control; for example, you want to stop any pending request when transitioning to a new screen; in that case, just throw the bag away.\nIt is also reasonable to have different bags at the same time so you can have more granular control over the lifetime of various disposables by adding them to different bags, this is perfectly fine. However, there might be better ways to handle those cases in more reactive ways (pun intended), we will talk more about this in future posts when we get to some nicely complicated examples 😉.\nAnyways, back on topic. Let's add a local attribute to our view\nlet disposeBag = DisposeBag()\n\nAnd then let's toss the disposable into the bag.\nprivate func refreshData() {\n    Service.getSystemState().subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n        // Something\n    }).disposed(by: self.disposeBag)\n}\n\nLet's pause for a moment, and let's talk about coding styles 👩‍🎨 If you have been looking at the RxSwift documentation you might have noticed a particular style, everything is in a new line. That's to make things easier to read, it doesn't look like much right now, but believe me, the moment we start piling operators it will become evident.\nLet's rewrite\nprivate func refreshData() {\n    Service.getSystemState()\n        .subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n            // Something\n        })\n        .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)\n}\n\nLet's do something with the response, basically what we were doing before:\nprivate func refreshData() {\n    Service.getSystemState()\n        .subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n            self.globalState = globalState\n            self.refreshData()\n        })\n        .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)\n}\n\nBy the way, I'm not using [weak self] as in SwiftUI views are structs, but that transitions ourselves into the question \"if views are value types and they are recreated when the state changes, what happens to the dispose bag and everything on them?\"\nThat part is a little tricky. Let's leave that for later when we have some more endpoints to play with, so the example is more straight forward and easy to follow.\nNow you can rerun the app and see that everything still works. 🎉\nI think it is time to wrap up this post.\nConclusions\nAt this point, if you think this was easy and useful, maybe you weren't paying too much attention. We gained nothing so far, we introduced a massive dependency, the code is way more verbose, our build times went out of the window, and we have nothing better than the closure we have at the beginning, which at last was very straight forward. Also, we are still doing polling in the most horrible way possible.\nDon't get me wrong, it is not that wrapping simple endpoints using Single is wrong, is just that so far I have shown you nothing new that can be done with RxSwift to make it a worthy addition into the codebase.\nIf you stay with me, I can show you some cool tricks and make all this worth it. For now, this was just an entreé, a warm-up. Let's spice things a little on the next post by introducing some errors and uncertainties and see how we can handle them with RxSwift\nUnit tests\nRegarding unit tests, there is not much to test so far, whatever test we could have for the original app are still valid as we haven't changed the behavior not introduced any new one.\nBonus track\nI'll give you a little bonus track for this first post when I built FakeService framework I used the concept of dependency injection described on pointfree.co, in particular starting on this episode: \"Dependency Injection Made Easy\".\nFakeService has a static struct with the name of Environment that exposes control to certain aspects of the framework, the ones that are more fun are:\n\ndelay: Controls the delay for each request.\ntick: Is the internal clock and returns the numbers of seconds since the start of the app.\n\nWith this we can make the app a little more interesting and useful, for example, we can override tick so instead of returning the number of seconds since the app launches it does something like this:\nlet referenceDate = Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: -600)\nFakeService.Current.tick = { -referenceDate.timeIntervalSinceNow}\n\nThis way, the recording starts playing 10 minutes into it, which is 1 minute before \"James\" completes a delivery. This is useful to retry the same scenario over and over again.\nOr we can get more crazy and do something like this:\nlet ticksPerSecond = 30\nlet referenceDate = Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 0)\nFakeService.Current.tick = { -referenceDate.timeIntervalSinceNow * Double(ticksPerSecond)}\nFakeService.Current.delay = { 0 }\n\nEvery real world second is 30 seconds worth of recording so things become a little more insteresting and less dull, which is nice to keep re-testing things without diying of boredom.\nAnyway, have fun with it, now you can watch the whole hour's worth of content without having to waste a real hour 😉.\n&nbsp;\nNext post\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFootnotes\n1: Theguardian.com The guardian: \"Master the art of presenting: tell a story, keep it brief\"\n2: Lucidpress.com \"How Airbnb and Apple build their brands with storytelling marketing\"\n3: Enricoangelini.com look for \"iPhone and iPad User Interface Design\"\n4: Yes, that was a joke and that's one of the good ones, so brace yourself.\n5: If this story hits close to home, please accept my condolences.\n","id":"https://julioacarrettoni.github.io/playing-with-rxswift/post-001/","title":"1.

It's time to start working on handling those error scenarios and add some unit tests to try to catch future bugs before they even happen.\nSkip intro\nBackground story\nThomson Brothers Division might be a medium company with some old technological stack, but that doesn't mean they do things wrong. The company has some modern processes in place to ensure a minimum level of code quality.\nFor example, they do Agile software development1. Probably someone read a fancy post on LinkedIn selling Agile facilitation consulting and though: \"This looks nice, and I don't need to pay someone to tell me how to run my team. I'll simply follow the first 3 chapters of this book, most of it doesn't apply to us anyway\" 2. And just like that, \"Agile TBD development process\" was born (pun intended).\nThey should have hired the consultant. It would have been cheaper in the long run…\nAnyway, as a result to that, one thing led to another, and the company ended up adopting and adapting \"git flow\"3, so now you have to create a \"pull request\"4 into the master branch from your refactor branch.\nBy following the company docs, you have to complete a checklist in the description of your pull request, some of which are:\n\nConsiders edge cases and non-happy paths\nHandle errors\n\nRecover from errors gracefully\nLogs errors.\n\n\nIntroduces new unit tests\n\nWithout this, the pull request will be rejected.\nIn the previous post, I intentionally avoided those for the sake of simplicity as it was getting a little too long. Now is time to pay the debt.\nNot every pull request has to introduce new unit tests, as I said on the previous post, there was not much to test as it was a refactor, now that we are about to improve the error handling and the user experience that might change.\n\n\nWork\nGoal\nFix any issues (bugs, bad user experience) the app might have when working under non-ideal conditions by completing each of the items in this list:\n\nConsiders edge cases and non-happy paths\nHandle errors\n\nRecover from errors gracefully\nLog errors.\n\n\nIntroduces new unit tests\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nCode\nYou will need Xcode 11.4 or newer.\nYou can download the sample apps from here, you should start working on the before folder, in the end, it should look like the after folder.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nConsiders edge cases and non-happy paths\nOpen the RxPlaying.xcodeproj project. The RxPlaying targets have no changes from the previous post, but the FakeService framework has received some small updates for this post, in particular, the Environment struct received a new member:\npublic var failNext: () -&gt; Bool\n\nReturning true in this closure makes the next request fail. Right now, there is no granular control on any of the closures as we only have a single endpoint, and I want to keep things simple.\nWe will use this to simulate bad networks when combined with the existing delay member.\nIn real life advanced network stacks provide with mock functionality else you can always simulate bad network conditions on your iPhone or your simulator without having to turn airplane mode on or turning off the Wi-Fi, here is a nice post by NatashaTheRobot for reference.\nAdd this method anywhere on Service.swift inside the Service struct.\nstatic func overrideNetworkMock() {\n    var failures = [false, true]\n    FakeService.Current.failNext = {\n        let next = failures.removeFirst()\n        failures.append(next)\n        return next\n    }\n}\n\nEvery time the closure gets invoked we return the first value on the failures array and push it to the back. It cycles through all the values of the array.\nNow we need to call this method once, a right place could be here in the SceneDelegate.swift file.\nIf you run the app half the requests will \"fail\" and it will look like this:\n\nEvery time the request fails a nil is returned and blindly forwarded to the MapView View\n.subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n    self.globalState = globalState\n    self.refreshData()\n})\n\nThe internal implementation of the MapView tries to animate annotation transitions. It fades out annotations that are removed and fades in annotations that are added. As a result, it fades out all annotations when the request fails as we are removing all of them by setting a globalState with nil value, and then it fades in all the annotations when a new value of globalState is received.\nWe can \"patch\" this issue in several places, starting with the bug on the MapView when fading in annotations due to view recycling, but in the meantime, we will ignore that as is not our main concern.\nWe can be tempted to do something like:\n.subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n    if let globalState = globalState {\n        self.globalState = globalState\n    }\n\n    self.refreshData()\n})\n\nAnd that will certainly fix the issue, but the proper \"fix\" is to start doing some real error handling and separating concerns.\nWe will see soon that this not only fixes the problem but also enables us to do more while keeping everything clean and separated.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nHandle errors, recover from errors gracefully\nLet's take a look back at our current implementation of the \"reactive\" endpoint:\nstatic func getSystemState() -&gt; Single&lt;GlobalState?&gt; {\n    Single&lt;GlobalState?&gt;.create { single in\n        FakeServices.shared.getSystemState { globalState in\n            single(.success(globalState))\n        }\n        \n        return Disposables.create()\n    }\n}\n\nTo be honest, FakeService doesn't really help us as it doesn't return any error, is just return a value or nil2, I hope that whatever network stack you have at work in real life is a little more cooperative than this one 😁.\nLet's concentrate on the \"body\" of our Single:\nFakeServices.shared.getSystemState { globalState in\n    single(.success(globalState))\n}\n\nWe want to only return .success if we have a value, an error otherwise.\nFakeServices.shared.getSystemState { globalState in\n    if let globalState = globalState {\n        single(.success(globalState))\n    } else {\n        single(.error( ?????????????? ))\n    }\n}\n\nOk, we need an error first, let's start by creating one inside Service.swift, an easy way is to use an enum with lots of clear cases and some vars for stuff like description, analytics, etc., but again we don't have much to work with given the current state of FakeService, this is as far as we can go (for now).\nenum GetSystemStateError: Error {\n    case unknown\n}\n\nNow the end result for the body is:\nFakeServices.shared.getSystemState { globalState in\n    if let globalState = globalState {\n        single(.success(globalState))\n    } else {\n        single(.error(GetSystemStateError.unknown))\n    }\n}\n\nLet's look at it, it is still easy to read and descriptive, plus now it is explicit that not getting a value from FakeServices.shared.getSystemState is considered an error.\nFurthermore we can now change the whole method and get ride of the optionals:\nstatic func getSystemState() -&gt; Single&lt;GlobalState&gt; {\n    Single&lt;GlobalState&gt;.create { single in\n        // Body\n    }\n}\n\nThis simplifies ContentView as we no longer have to wonder what does it means for the Single to return a nil.\nIf we run the app now, it won't blink anymore, but also it won't do anything else that rendering a single service call.\nThe problem is that our current precarious polling system relies on ContentView.refreshData to call itself at the end and when it fails it doesn't retry as we are not currently handling the error cases.\nLet's take a look at it:\nprivate func refreshData() {\n    Service.getSystemState()\n        .subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n            self.globalState = globalState\n            self.refreshData()\n        })\n        .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)\n}\n\nThe subscribe method has another argument that we are currently ignoring in our naive usage of the reactive API, onError, let's use it:\nService.systemSingle\n    .subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n        self.globalState = globalState\n        self.refreshData()\n    }, onError: { _ in\n        self.refreshData()\n    })\n    .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)\n\nNow, if you run the application, it will look lovely as before, even if every other request fails, furthermore we have a decent separation between the happy path and the sad path. As a reminder, we have different subscribe options that were discussed in the previous post here.\nNow it seems we have covered the \"handle errors gracefully\" section, spoiler alert, we haven't, what we won't notice until a little later in the post.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIntermission\nSkip intermission\nBefore continuing talking about logging and testability, there is something I would like to show you, on the previous post I mentioned that we can re-use the same single multiple times (here), so why use a method? Why are we re-creating the same Instance over an over again? I mean is not like is a huge performance boost, plus \"[…] premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.\"5 Donald Knuth.\nStill, this is the right thing to do plus 0.001% over time compounds and 🦆 our application's performance.\nWhat we can do is to use a static variable we only create once:\nstatic var systemSingle: Single&lt;GlobalState&gt; = {\n    Single&lt;GlobalState&gt;.create { single in\n        // Body\n        return Disposables.create()\n    }\n}()\n\nThat we can reuse directly:\nprivate func refreshData() {\n    Service.systemSingle\n        .subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n            // Body\n        )\n        .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)\n}\n\nIf you don't believe me (I don't blame you, and you shouldn't trust me to be honest), you can try it yourself and add a print line here (and also a return)\nstatic var systemSingle: Single&lt;GlobalState&gt; = {\n    print(\"Creating the single one single time.\")\n    return Single&lt;GlobalState&gt;.create { single in\n\nNow the app works just as before, and we just gained little performance boost… maybe?.\nNow back to our regular programing...\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHandle errors, Log errors.\nLet's log some errors on the client, for simplicity our logs will be just printing to the console AKA \"poor man's debugger\".\nAn straight forward change could be:\nonError: { error in\n    print(\"[\\(#function)] ❌ request error: \\(error)\")\n    self.refreshData()\n})\n\nRight now this feels like enough as we only use the endpoint in a single place, but it would be good to have the logging at the endpoint level too, then we can see how often and endpoint fails and also if we use it in different parts of our app which one is more affected.\nWe might be tempted to modify the body of our single and log the error in the same place where we are creating it:\nFakeServices.shared.getSystemState { globalState in\n    if let globalState = globalState {\n        single(.success(globalState))\n    } else {\n        // Not good enough \n        let error = GetSystemStateError.unknown\n        print(\"[\\(#function)] ❌ request error: \\(error)\")\n        single(.error(error))\n    }\n}\n\nBut there is a better way, the RxWay. All observables have a handy operator called do, and this one is a big one:\n\nInvokes an action for each event in the observable sequence, and propagates all observer messages through the result sequence.\nsee also: do operator on reactivex.io\n· onSuccess: Action to invoke for each element in the observable sequence.\n· afterSuccess: Action to invoke for each element after the observable has passed an onNext event along to its downstream.\n· onError: Action to invoke upon errored termination of the observable sequence.\n· afterError: Action to invoke after errored termination of the observable sequence.\n· onSubscribe: Action to invoke before subscribing to source observable sequence.\n· onSubscribed: Action to invoke after subscribing to source observable sequence.\n· onDispose: Action to invoke after subscription to source observable has been disposed for any reason. It can be either because sequence terminates for some reason or observer subscription being disposed.\nreturns: The source sequence with the side-effecting behavior applied.\n\nThis operator should not be confused with map or any of its variants as this method does not modify the stream in any way, that's what \"[…]and propagates all observer messages through the result sequence\" means. Also, as you can see, it has a lot of options to \"hook into\", this makes do great for logging and also debugging your code, by the way, there is a debug operator as well.\nNow we can add this at the end of our Single definition, and we will be effortlessly \"logging\" all results from it no matter where we use it.\n.do(onSuccess: { _ in\n    print(\"[\\(#function)] ✅ Success\")\n}, onError: { error in\n    print(\"[\\(#function)] ❌ request error: \\(error)\")\n})\n\nThis is the output of the console now:\n\n[Service] ✅ Success\n[Service] ❌ request error: unknown\n[refreshData()] ❌ request error: unknown\n[Service] ✅ Success\n[Service] ❌ request error: unknown\n[refreshData()] ❌ request error: unknown\n[Service] ✅ Success\n[Service] ❌ request error: unknown\n[refreshData()] ❌ request error: unknown\n\nWe can also go back to ContentView and add a do there so we can separate logging from business logic like this:\nprivate func refreshData() {\n    Service.systemSingle\n➡️      .do(onError: { error in\n➡️          print(\"[\\(#function)] ❌ request error: \\(error)\")\n➡️      })                                                    \n        .subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n            self.globalState = globalState\n            self.refreshData()\n        }, onError: { error in\n            self.refreshData()\n        })\n        .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)\n}\n\nIf we found ourselves writing the same do to log over and over again we might as well extend PrimitiveSequenceType and add our on log function, so our call site looks cleaner:\nprivate func refreshData() {\n    Service.systemSingle\n➡️      .logErrors()\n        .subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n            self.globalState = globalState\n            self.refreshData()\n        }, onError: { error in\n            self.refreshData()\n        })\n        .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)\n}\n\nThat's up to you. I won't do it to keep the code as vanilla as possible to avoid confusion.\nAnd with that, we saw how easy it is to add logs to our system while still retaining some separation between business logic and logs/analytics.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIntroduces new unit tests\nIt's time to add some unit tests, the question now is \"What should we test?\" The more tests we write, the better, but writing tests just for the sake of it is not good.\nAnyway, let's check the changes we introduced and what should we test. I personally like to use the tests to document my assumptions, so if at any time one of those assumptions change the test will warn all of us that something might break, you have the draw the line somewhere though, for example, I'm going to assume that RxSwift is stable and tested enough, so I don't have to verify stuff like a do always propagates events down the line.\nWe haven't made to many changes though, we removed the requirement of the optional (the compiler takes care of ensuring that) and introduced a new error, but our logic doesn't even care what kind of error we get, so can we say that there isn't anything worth testing?\nLet's look closer, we did make an assumption, and a big one, we are assuming that the single will always send back an event, either an element or an error.\nSomeone could, by mistake remove the line that emits the error:\nFakeServices.shared.getSystemState { globalState in\n    if let globalState = globalState {\n        single(.success(globalState))\n    } else {\n➡️      single(.error(GetSystemStateError.unknown))\n    }\n}\n\nNo, I'm not being too far fetched or pessimist, you think it is impossible for someone to come and remove that crucial line, well in this context it seems highly unlikely given the simplicity of the program. Still, even on the most simple logics someone making a big refactor and solving a rebase with lots conflicts might get confused and solve it the wrong way, it can happen (I have seen it MANY times) and if this situation happens it would be terrible as neither of the logs we have will catch it.\nSo first things first, we need to create a new target on the project for our tests, you can google that out, but here is a simple recap:\n\nSelect the project on the file navigator tab.\nClick the + button to add a new target.\nSelect the unit test template (The default values are more than fine).\n\n\nNow find the RxPlayingTests.swift file, get rid of the testPerformanceExample function as we won't use it and rename testExample to something more representative, but remember it has to always be prefixed with the word test, take no arguments and return void6. I'm awful at naming things (Take the blog or the fake company as good examples), but a convention is what-is-being-tested+the-state-change+expected-value so maybe testSystemSingleWhenFailsReturnsError is a proper name.\nfunc testSystemSingleWhenFailsReturnsError() throws {\n    // This is an example of a functional test case.\n    // Use XCTAssert and related functions to verify your tests produce the correct results.\n}\n\nAnd now what?\nFirst, let's import the Target we want to test with the @testable attribute7, so we have access to its internal members and also the FakeService module as we will use it.\n@testable import RxPlaying\nimport FakeService\n\nIn real life we would need to introduce some dependency injection mechanism so we can switch the FakeService with a MockService we can control and force it to return nil on-demand and avoid making network calls, unit tests that make network calls are not unit tests, no matter what arguments you use they are all wrong to me. Luckily to us, FakeService comes with a mocking mechanism (is a Mock after all).\nSo let's setup our tests on setUpWithError by setting the delay to 0 as that's something we want for all our tests.\noverride func setUpWithError() throws {\n    FakeService.Current.delay =  { 0 }\n}\n\nAnd let's make all request fail at the beginning of our test since that's the condition we want to test\nfunc testSystemSingleWhenFailsReturnsError() throws {\n    FakeService.Current.failNext = { true }\n\n}\n\nNow we are ready to test, we need to subscribe to Service.systemSingle, as we are only interested in testing if we get an error we select the version of subscribe that has onSuccess:onError:, (You can refresh this topic here)\nAgain we are only interested in the error so we can ignore the onSuccess:.\nIf on error gets call then the test passes, we trigger that with XCTAssert(true).\nService.systemSingle\n    .subscribe(onError: { _ in\n        XCTAssert(true) // If we hit this line we are good!\n})\n\nIf you run your test, it passes! 🎉 So are we done?\nNo\nRule number #1 when writing tests is \"Tests that your tests fail.\"\nTests are build to fail, and you HAVE to make sure they fail at least when you expect them to fail; otherwise, the test is pointless. (Also that code if you are following the post on your Xcode that code is emitting warnings, so there is something fishy with it, to say the least)\nLet's change the failNext closure, so requests don't fail, that should make the test fail.\nFakeService.Current.failNext = { false }\n\nBut if we rerun the test, it won't fail.\nYou can play putting breakpoints and check that when failNext is set to true, our XCTAssert(true) is indeed executed, but when failNext is set to false it is not, so why is the test passing? Easy, if it doesn't fail, it passes. Tests are intended to check for failure conditions. That's why we have XCTFail() but not XCTSuccess() method.\nOne could be tempted to change the test to this so you can indeed test the failure scenarios:\nService.systemSingle\n    .subscribe(onSuccess: { _ in XCTFail() })\n\nAnd if you are lucky enough, your test may pass, but it won't always, there is a race condition, and you might end up with an exception \"Parameter \"test\" must not be nil.\" which basically happens when a test fails after it had finished running.\nThe nature of the system we are testing is asynchronous, and we should test it properly, for that we will use expectations8.\nExpectations are easy to use, you create one, on an asynchronous task you set it to \"fulfilled\", and then you \"pause\" the execution of the test using a XCTWaiter and a timeout, if the expectation is not fulfilled before the time passes the test fail.\nAs XCTestCase conforms to the XCTWaiterDelegate, we can just do self.wait.\nHere is the code:\nfunc testSystemSingleWhenFailsReturnsError() throws {\n   FakeService.Current.failNext = { true }\n   \n   let expectation = XCTestExpectation(description: \"We get an error if the request fails\")\n   \n   Service.systemSingle\n       .subscribe(onError: { _ in\n           expectation.fulfill()\n       })\n   \n   self.wait(for: [expectation], timeout: 0.1)\n}\n\nIf you run the test, it will pass, and if you flip the value of failNext it fails with a glorious: _Asynchronous wait failed: Exceeded timeout of 0.1 seconds, with unfulfilled expectations: \"We get an error if the request fails\"._\nLet's improve the test a little, first, let's fix the warning by creating a dispose bag and retaining the returned value of susbcribe. In this case, we can do it locally as the wait will hold the execution, and the current scope won't end before time disposing of our bag, and it's content.\nfunc testSystemSingleWhenFailsReturnsError() throws {\n   FakeService.Current.failNext = { true }\n   \n   let expectation = XCTestExpectation(description: \"We get an error if the request fails\")\n   \n   let disposeBag = Service.systemSingle\n       .subscribe(onError: { _ in\n           expectation.fulfill()\n       })\n   \n   self.wait(for: [expectation], timeout: 0.1)\n   disposeBag.dispose()\n}\n\nAlso, it is a good idea to \"fail fast\", it doesn't look like much, but if this test fails, it fails after 0.1 seconds, if you have 10 tests failing that's at least 1 second of extra delay, if you have hundreds, the test suit could be delayed a lot when there is a change breaking multiple tests and running CI costs money baby.\nSo let's also fail fast by failing if the onSuccess: closure ever gets hit.\n.subscribe(onSuccess: { _ in\n   XCTFail()\n}, onError: { _ in\n   expectation.fulfill()\n})\n\nBut if you followed my advice and verified that the test fails when it should you would have noticed it failed because of the time up, not because of the timeout and not because of the XCTFail() even when that lines get hit (go on put a breakpoint and try), that's because there is something not right9 with XCTestCase so we should use XCTWaiter directly, now the final version of the test looks like this:\nfunc testSystemSingleWhenFailsReturnsError() throws {\n    FakeService.Current.failNext = { true }\n    \n    let expectation = XCTestExpectation(description: \"We get an error if the request fails\")\n    \n    let disposeBag = Service.systemSingle\n        .subscribe(onSuccess: { _ in\n            XCTFail(\"We shouldn't get a result\")\n        }, onError: { _ in\n            expectation.fulfill()\n        })\n    \n    XCTAssertEqual(XCTWaiter.wait(for: [expectation], timeout: 0.1), .completed)\n    disposeBag.dispose()\n}\n\nAnd it fails when we expect it to fail even if we comment out the following line in Service.swift:\nsingle(.error(GetSystemStateError.unknown))\n\nNow the PR is ready, and we should send around so people can comment that { should go in a different line or that our test should have a different name2 🤣\nAnd remember, if you don't want people nitpicking your PRs, just make one with over 100 lines of codes, nobody really reviews those… Just kidding, don't be an a*shole, your coworkers know where you sit.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\nConclusion\nI hope now you start to see the value of RxSwift over a more simple closure based approach, like how easy is to keep the business logic separated from logging and analytics code or the capacity of the operator do to chain actions on our stream of events in one or many places along that is more elegant than nesting closures one inside the other. \nAlso as you can see testing RxSwift is not that bad (in this easy example 😉)\nEven something so simple as a Single comes with a lot of operators, we will see more on the next post, because before you can get your PR merged the worse will happen, a feature request in the form of \"since you are touching that part of the app, would you mind making a small change for me?\" will happen shifting priorities and affecting the scope of the entire project2, Spoiler alert is not fixing a typo.\nYes, that's a cliff hanger.\n&nbsp;\nNext post\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFootnotes\n1: Wikipedia.org Agile software development.\n2: If this story hits close to home, please accept my condolences.\n3: Nvie.com \"A successful Git branching model\" By Vincent Driessen.\n4: Help.github.com \"About pull requests\".\n5: Wikiquote.org Donald Knuth.\n6: Developer.apple.com Writing Test Methods.\n7: Developer.apple.com Writing Tests with Swift.\n8: Developer.apple.com Testing Asynchronous Operations with Expectations.\n9: After digging a little on the matter I found several wrong stuffs with it, luckily @SmileyKeith found and reported them some time ago. \n","id":"https://julioacarrettoni.github.io/playing-with-rxswift/post-002/","title":"2.

Is the current strategy for polling strong enough?\nSkip intro\nBackground story\nYou were ready to request other engineers to review your humble pull request. Still, out of nowhere, a product manager approaches you with concern: Most of the employees using this app are not going to be in the warehouse. When in the warehouse, they can access the legacy system on their computers. Furthermore, warehouses don't have good Wi-Fi coverage anyway.\nThis product manager wants to bump a feature from milestone 3 into the MVP, the ability to switch between auto-polling and manual refresh.\nOf course, without the features introduced on milestones 1 and 2, this feature doesn't make too much sense. There is no settings page, plus there is no network request queue mechanism, and there is no login/logout, so you complain that the original ticket is not appropriate.\nThe product manager creates a new ticket, and with the help from a senior designer, in a couple of minutes, they have something that should be good enough 1. However, without a proper analysis, we are bound to have some questions down the implementation road.\nYou can complain that changing the plan is a bad idea, and is ok to raise concerns to question if these changes are worth the trouble, but at the end of the day, that's what the agile manifesto is all about2. \nThe new requirements are:\n\nShow a toggle at the bottom of the map to turn auto-polling ON/OFF.\nWhen auto polling is OFF, a \"refresh\" button should be visible.\nThe \"refresh\" button fires a network request to get the latest state of the system but does not enable auto-polling.\n\nA coworker recommends creating a PR for the current changes we already have. At the same time, branch out from it and start working on our new feature. This way, we can avoid creating a hella of a big PR with too many changes at once.\nAs a reminder, all PRs have to:\n\nConsiders edge cases and non-happy paths\nHandle errors\nIntroduces new unit tests\n\n\n\nWork\nGoal\nAdd a new feature into the MVP, a toggle to control auto-polling and a \"refresh\" button to refresh the system state manually:\n\nShow a toggle at the bottom of the map to turn auto-polling ON/OFF.\nWhen auto polling is OFF, a \"refresh\" button should be visible.\nThe \"refresh\" button fires a network request to get the latest state of the system but does not enable auto-polling. \n\nComply with the pull request requirements:\n\nConsiders edge cases and non-happy paths\nHandle errors\nIntroduces new unit tests\n\nCode\nYou need Xcode 11.4 or newer.\nYou can download the sample apps from here, you should start working on the before folder. In the end, it should look like the after folder.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nUI changes\nThe usual disclaimer applies here, as this blog is not focused on SwiftUI, all the work done in that area is minimal and with a naive approach in mind.\nFor this reason, on the Before project, you can find that the UI changes already implemented, a very naive way.\n\nIf we wanted to be super technical these are the changes:\n struct ContentView: View {\n     @State var globalState: GlobalState? = nil\n+    @State var isAutoPolling: Bool = false\n+    \n     let disposeBag = DisposeBag()\n     \n     var body: some View {\n-        MapView(globalState: self.globalState)\n-            .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)\n-            .onAppear(perform: self.refreshData)\n+        VStack {\n+            MapView(globalState: self.globalState)\n+            VStack {\n+                if !self.isAutoPolling {\n+                    Button(action: {\n+                        #warning(\"Missing implementation\")\n+                    }) { Text(\"Refresh\") }\n+                }\n+                Toggle(isOn: self.$isAutoPolling, label: { Text(\"Auto Polling\") })\n+            }\n+            .padding(.horizontal, 16)\n+            .padding(.bottom, 16)\n+        }\n+        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.horizontal)\n+        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.top)\n     }\n\nIn the real world, given how the ticket was rushed and the lack of specifications, the proper thing to do would be to set a meeting later in the development process to spend some time with the designer 1:1 to pimp this UI up.\nA new Bool state was added to track the state of the toggle, isAutoPolling. Given the value of this boolean, the Button is added or removed from the UI (just changing its opacity is not good enough, you can try yourself). Then a couple of padding was added to make it look less horrible, and the  edgesIgnoringSafeArea was split to remove .bottom and avoid or toggle from getting behind the \"home bar\" on iOS.\nThe first thing we can do is fix the warning in the \"refresh\" button by calling self.refreshData():\nButton(action: {\n    self.refreshData()\n}) { Text(\"Refresh\") }\n\nBut doing this has a side effect, as soon as we call refreshData() the system starts auto polling, to prevent that we can change the method implementation to only keep calling itself if isAutoPolling is on. \n   .subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n       self.globalState = globalState\n-      self.refreshData()\n+      if self.isAutoPolling {\n+          self.refreshData()\n+      }\n   }, onError: { error in\n-      self.refreshData()\n+      if self.isAutoPolling {\n+          self.refreshData()\n+      }\n   })\n\n\nThe only missing part here is that when we set isAutoPolling to true, nothing calls  refreshData(). To achieve that we could try to leverage didSet on the var itself like this:\n-    @State var isAutoPolling: Bool = false\n+    @State var isAutoPolling: Bool = false {\n+        didSet {\n+            if self.isAutoPolling {\n+                self.refreshData()\n+            }\n+        }\n+    }\n\nAs I said, \"try\" you can already imagine this fails. The problem is the automatic biding provided by the $ sugar syntax from @state: propertyWrapper. It doesn't trigger didSet.\nOne alternative is to wrap the state in an ObservableObject. I'll go with option B because I'm lazy, the usual disclaimer applies here: \"This is not a SwiftUI blog blah blah blah\", so maybe don't do this on your real apps without consulting some expert in the matter. Anyway, my solution is to provide a custom instance of Binding by using the init that takes a get and set closure.\nToggle(isOn: Binding(get: {\n    self.isAutoPolling\n}, set: {\n    self.isAutoPolling = $0\n}), label: { Text(\"Auto Polling\") })\n\nWe could just call directly self.refreshData() here, but I think keeping it on the didSet and this binding as simple as possible is better. (opinion, not fact).\nIf you rerun the app, you will see that it works, at least half of the time (because we still have that code that makes 50% of the request fail). Even if we don't want to focus too much on usability to keep the post simple and focused, we still need to cover the following 3 points before we can create our fictitious pull request:\n\nConsiders edge cases and non-happy paths.\nHandle errors.\nIntroduces new unit tests.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n1. Considers edge cases and non-happy paths.\nAs we still have the overrideNetworkMock() method from the previous post we can run the app and see how it would look like in a scenario were every other network request fails.\nFor the auto-polling feature, this is not a big deal because we are automatically retrying on the onError closure from the subscribe Rx operator (here), but that's not the case for the manual refresh.\nNormally any network stack has built-in \"retry\" and \"timeout\", but this is not the case with our FakeService, so we are going to implement the retry at the application level using the retry operator:\n/**\n     If the initial subscription to the observable sequence emits an error event, try repeating it up to the specified number of attempts (inclusive of the initial attempt) or until it succeeds. For example, if you want to retry a sequence once upon failure, you should use retry(2) (once for the initial attempt, and once for the retry).\n     - see also: [retry operator on reactivex.io](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/retry.html)\n     - parameter maxAttemptCount: Maximum number of times to attempt the sequence subscription.\n     - returns: An observable sequence producing the elements of the given sequence repeatedly until it terminates successfully.\n     */\npublic func retry(_ maxAttemptCount: Int)\n\nWhen an error message reaches this operator, it blocks that error message from propagating down the chain, then retries the previous action again. In the context of Singles, that means executing the closure block once again.\nThe nice thing about it as any other operator is that we can place it anywhere in the stream (as long as we do it before the subscribe off course), but this is tricky as depending were we put it we get slighly different results, for example we could place it here:\nService.systemSingle\n    .do(onError: { error in\n        print(\"[\\(#function)] ❌ request error: \\(error)\")\n    })\n+   .retry(3)\n    .subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n\n3 seems like a nice number, but you can use whatever makes sense to you.\nWhen you tap the refresh button, logs look like this:\n\n[Service] ❌ request error: unknown\n[refreshData()] ❌ request error: unknown\n[Service] ✅ Success\n\nIt fails but then retries and succeeds. (every other request fails, so on the second attempt it always succeeds)\nBut if you put it before the do like this, the ouput is different:\nService.systemSingle\n+   .retry(3)\n    .do(onError: { error in\n        print(\"[\\(#function)] ❌ request error: \\(error)\")\n    })\n    .subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n\n\n[Service] ❌ request error: unknown\n[Service] ✅ Success\n\nWhat's happening here is that the stream retries 2 more times before letting the error reach the do operator and printing the error inside refreshData().\nWe can modify this line in  overrideNetworkMock() so it always fails:\nvar failures = [true]\n\nAnd the log now will look like this:\n\n[Service] ❌ request error: unknown\n[Service] ❌ request error: unknown\n[Service] ❌ request error: unknown\n[refreshData()] ❌ request error: unknown\n\nAs you can see, it runs the entire set of operators up to the retry 3 times before letting the error event go down the chain. \nWe could even put the .retry(3) higher on the stream, inside the implementation of static var systemSingle: Single&lt;GlobalState&gt;. Again, we have different results if we put it before or after the do.\nThe placement of the retry is not a trivial decision. It all depends on what is necessary for us to log. Maybe, we want to know of every network request failure, then it should go after the second do. Maybe, we want to track every API network request failure, but we consider failure at the application level only when the retry fails, then it should go in between the 2 do.\nMaybe, for us, failures are serious when all the retries fail and not per every single network request; in that case, it should be the very first operator in the chain.\nI think this last case is the one that makes more sense for this app, so I'll keep the retry(3) there.\nNow we can say that we have considered non-happy paths, but what about edge cases?\nThere is a nasty one if the user taps on refresh and immediately turns on auto-polling. The app ends up double auto polling because after the manual refresh ends self.isAutoPolling is true and thus fires a new request as if it was auto-polling, but we also have another \"thread\" doing auto-polling. A quick fix for this is introducing a new argument into our function to differentiate auto-poll from manual refresh:\nprivate func refreshData(autopolling: Bool)\nif self.isAutoPolling &amp;&amp; autopolling {\n    self.refreshData(autopolling: autopolling)\n}\n\nAnd call it with false on the refresh button, but with true on the didSet\nNow we can say that we have considered edge cases and non-happy paths.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n2. Handle errors.\nThere is one error to handle, what happens if after 3 retries the manual refresh fails? Currently, nothing, but to be honest, there isn't too much happening when you press the refresh button anyways.\nWe could show an alert on the onError closure, but that will also show alerts when auto-polling fails, one after the other, that's bad. We can use the autopolling boolean and only show the alert with the boolean is false, but to be honest, this method is getting a little bloated, there's gotta be a better way.\nLet's split it in 2 different methods, but if we do that then we have a lot of duplicated code! To avoid that, we can create a private function to hold what's common to each method, and pass the function name so our log keeps showing relevant information:\nprivate func fetchGlobalState(from function: String = #function) -&gt; Single&lt;GlobalState&gt; {\n    return Service.systemSingle\n        .do(onError: { error in\n            print(\"[\\(function)] ❌ request error: \\(error)\")\n        })\n}\n\nAnd then we can use it on our 2 new methods where we only do what is relevant to each and we get to keep the code as simple as possible:\nprivate func refresh() {\n    self.fetchGlobalState()\n        .subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n            self.globalState = globalState\n        }, onError: { error in\n            self.showErrorAlert()\n        })\n        .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)\n}\n\nprivate func autoPoll() {\n    self.fetchGlobalState()\n        .subscribe(onSuccess: { globalState in\n            self.globalState = globalState\n            if self.isAutoPolling {\n                self.autoPoll()\n            }\n        }, onError: { error in\n            if self.isAutoPolling {\n                self.autoPoll()\n            }\n        })\n        .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)\n}\n\nI'm going to skip all the problems of showing an alert on SwiftUI as Paul Hudson already did a great job here, go and read his fantastic website, subscribe, like, retweet and all of that. You can just go and peek the after project to find it out.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n3. Introduces new unit tests.\nNow, we need to ask ourselves \"What assumptions are we making?\", in other words, what can be proven catastrophic in the app if it got changed?\nMost of our changes are UI related, but there is one change that we made to the behavior of the service that we can test, and that's the retry(3). Without it, the experience of the app would be significantly degraded. We are going to test that there is a retry mechanism in place. We don't care what it is just as long as when a request fails it gets automatically retried.\nOur first test is to make sure the Single gets fired 3 times when the service returns error before failing, so a name for it could be:\n\ntest + SystemSingle + InternallyRetries3Times +When + FailsReturnsError \n\nYou can refresh your memory on how we are writing our tests and the naming convention on the previous post in this section.\nWe are going to return true always for FakeService.Current.failNext to make sure all requests in this test fail.\nWe need to ensure that the service call gets retried. One way to do that is to count how many times the FakeService.Current.failNext is gets executed, as this closure runs on every fake network request. We have many options for this, like using a local var and then asserting its value. Given the async nature of the whole business, the best approach is to use XCTestExpectation, and it's properties expectedFulfillmentCount and assertForOverFulfill which names are pretty straight forward.\nlet failNextExpectation = XCTestExpectation(description: \"FailNext gets executed 3 times\")\nfailNextExpectation.expectedFulfillmentCount = 3\nfailNextExpectation.assertForOverFulfill = true\n\nThis XCTestExpectation fails the test if at the end the expectation was fulfilled less than 3 times and crashes the test with an exception if they get fulfilled more than 3, a little overreaction if you ask me 😅\nWe can also use a different XCTestExpectation to ensure that the onError: closure on subscribe only gets executed  once:\nlet onErrorExpectation = XCTestExpectation(description: \"We get an error if the request fails\")\nonErrorExpectation.expectedFulfillmentCount = 1\nonErrorExpectation.assertForOverFulfill = true\n\nThe whole test now looks like this:\nfunc testSystemSingleInternallyRetries3TimesWhenFailsReturnsError() throws {\n    let failNextExpectation = XCTestExpectation(description: \"FailNext gets executed 3 times\")\n    failNextExpectation.expectedFulfillmentCount = 3\n    failNextExpectation.assertForOverFulfill = true\n    \n    let onErrorExpectation = XCTestExpectation(description: \"We get an error if the request fails\")\n    onErrorExpectation.expectedFulfillmentCount = 1\n    onErrorExpectation.assertForOverFulfill = true\n    \n    FakeService.Current.failNext = {\n        failNextExpectation.fulfill()\n        return true\n    }\n    \n    let disposeBag = Service.systemSingle\n        .subscribe(onSuccess: { _ in\n            XCTFail(\"We shouldn't get a result\")\n        }, onError: { _ in\n            onErrorExpectation.fulfill()\n        })\n    \n    XCTAssertEqual(XCTWaiter.wait(for: [failNextExpectation, onErrorExpectation], timeout: 0.1), .completed)\n    disposeBag.dispose()\n}\n\nAs you can see, the test is pretty straightforward to read, and there is no funny business with counters or accumulators.\nNow you should go ahead and remove the .retry(3) call, or change the number of retries, or change the value returned in FakeService.Current.failNext and verify that the test indeed fails. Don't take my word for it, and don't take yours either. You should always verify your test fails when they are expected to fail, otherwise the test is useless.\nThe next thing we can test is that the single succeeds if any of the retries succeeds as well. A name for this test can be:\n\ntest + SystemSingle + Succeeds + When + RetrySucceeds\n\nFor that we need to tweak FakeService.Current.failNext so it only fails the first time, we can do:\nvar failNext = false\nFakeService.Current.failNext = {\n    failNext.toggle()\n    return failNext\n}\n\nThis new code fails every other request starting with a failure.\nFor the rest we can use 2 XCTestExpectation again, to verify that the success closure is called exactly once and that that FakeService.Current.failNext is called exactly twice. With all of these changes the will look like these:\nfunc testSystemSingleSucceedsWhenRetrySucceeds() throws {\n    let failNextExpectation = XCTestExpectation(description: \"FailNext gets executed 2 times\")\n    failNextExpectation.expectedFulfillmentCount = 2\n    failNextExpectation.assertForOverFulfill = true\n    \n    let successExpectation = XCTestExpectation(description: \"We get a success event\")\n    successExpectation.expectedFulfillmentCount = 1\n    successExpectation.assertForOverFulfill = true\n    \n    var failNext = false\n    FakeService.Current.failNext = {\n        failNextExpectation.fulfill()\n        failNext.toggle()\n        return failNext\n    }\n    \n    let disposeBag = Service.systemSingle\n        .subscribe(onSuccess: { _ in\n            successExpectation.fulfill()\n        }, onError: { _ in\n            XCTFail(\"It shouldn't fail.\")\n        })\n    \n    XCTAssertEqual(XCTWaiter.wait(for: [failNextExpectation, successExpectation], timeout: 0.1), .completed)\n    disposeBag.dispose()\n}\n\nAs I said before, change some numbers, change the retry, do whatever change you deem necessary to verify that the test is working and catching errors.\nAs you might have discovered if you followed my advice, when an expectation fails it hard to tell which one did, if instead of  XCTAssertEqual(XCTWaiter.wait(for:, timeout:), .completed) we used self.wait(for:, timeout:) tests would fail more gracefully. Sadly there is a bug currently affecting the correctness of this API, it was believed to be fixed recently, but it wasn't.\nThe bug mostly makes tests way slower on big projects. If the current way fails and you have more than one expectation you can switch temporarily to self.wait(for:, timeout:) to get a better error message or if your project is small and you don't care if it takes a little longer to run the tests just stick with the simpler version. Hopefully, it will be fixed soon 🤞.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\nConclusion\nIf we look at all the changes we made, our current implementation holds it pretty well. The polling mechanism is still quite weak but is good enough.\nWe leveraged the power of RxSwift by using the retry operator.\nWe saw how easy it is to share code between different consumers of the same Single by splitting the method and have one holding the common operator for the others.\nWe also added some helpful tests to safeguard our code quality.\nNow before we open the PR, we should double-check with the designer and see if they have any suggestions… (yes, another cliff hanger)\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFootnotes\n1: If this story hits close to home, please accept my condolences.\n\n2: Agilemanifesto.org \"Responding to change over following a plan\".\n","id":"https://julioacarrettoni.github.io/playing-with-rxswift/post-003/","title":"3.
